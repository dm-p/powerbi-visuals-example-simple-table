# powerbi-visuals-example-simple-table

This is a very simple demonstration of the `table` data view mapping for the Power BI Custom Visuals SDK, and is [documented in this online post](https://www.coacervo.co/examples/table-dv-simple). Please refer to that article for further details.

To work with this repository, you will need the Power BI Custom Visuals SDK installed. [Refer here for instructions on setting up your developer environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/custom-visual-develop-tutorial#setting-up-the-developer-environment).

Once checked out, and the pre-requisites set up, you just need to run:

```
npm i
```

From the root of the checkout, and then:

```
pbiviz start
```

To run the visual server. You can then test in the Power BI service.
